# CSC/ECE 517 Spring 2024 - E2429. Reimplement student_task list

## Expertiza
The Expertiza application is a collaborative platform used by students and instructors for managing assignments, peer reviews, and feedback.

## Problem Statement
The current student task list interface lacks responsiveness, usability, and performance. The objective is to reimplement the frontend of the student task list using React JS and TypeScript. This reimplementation aims to enhance the user experience, improve task management, and optimize performance.

The project will focus on the following features:
1. Dynamic Task Table: Display a table listing student assignments.
   Columns: Assignment name, course, topic, current stage, review grade, badges, stage
   deadline, and publishing rights.
   Implement sorting and filtering functionalities for efficient task navigation.
2. Responsive Design: Prioritize accessibility and user-friendly layouts.
3. Lazy Loading: Optimize performance by loading content only when necessary.
   Improve page load times for a smoother user experience.


## For the student tasks box table (side table)
- The test data comes from assignments.json
- Current interfaces are in 'StudentTasks/interfaces.ts', for future implementation, please change it accordingly
- The style is in 'StudentTasks/StudentTasksBox.css'
- Full implementation is in 'StudentTasks/StudentTasksBox.tsx'
- The Revisions part has no implementation as the meaning of this part is unclear, if it turns out to be unnecessary, please delete it
